# CMPM 121 D2 Project

This is my D1 Project for the class CMPM 121 at UC Santa Cruz. Essentially, it is a sticker sketchpad where you can use your mouse and draw on the canvas. There are very basic editing tools, such as an undo, redo, clear, and export button. You can change the thickness of your marker, as well as being able to place the default stickers on the canvas or create your emoji stickers using the (+) button. You are also able to change the color of your marker and the rotation of the sticker you want to place. Knock yourself out!
